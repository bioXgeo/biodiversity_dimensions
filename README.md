This code will allow the user to follow the entire data processing pipeline described in the manuscript. However, due to constraints on the amount of raw data we can include on this repository, we are only providing a small subset of the data encompassing the US state of New Hampshire. In addition, we are only providing a subset of the environmental covariate layers. 

For the model fitting steps, we are providing all the data used to fit the models in the manuscript, except for the true locations of the FIA plots due to confidentiality.
